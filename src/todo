BUG 2
#####

line 121 msh_data.c:     nl_cache_foreach_filter(addr_cache, (struct nl_object *)filter, __init_addr, 0);
This function makes a segmentation fault, so it's commented right now.
its backtrace is
#0  0x00007ffff76b4f05 in memcpy () from /lib/libc.so.6
#1  0x00000000004056cb in __init_addr ()
